Set up your profile by following these guidelines: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/setting-up-your-profile Make sure to have repository that matches your username and that contains a README file with some information about yourself. You can freely decide about what you want to share with the others and the public. Please remember, you have to use Markdown in order to render the contents properly.
