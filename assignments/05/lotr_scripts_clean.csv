Aragorn, My lord Elrond ,The Return of the King
Elrond,I come on behalf of one whom I love.  Arwen is dying.  She will not long     survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.  The light of the evenstar is     failing.  As Saurons power grows her strength wanes.  Arwens life is now     tied to the fate of the Ring.  The Shadow is upon us Aragorn.  The end has     come. ,The Return of the King
Aragorn,"It will not be our end, but his.   ",The Return of the King
Elrond,"  You ride to war     but not to victory.  Saurons armies ride on Minas Tirith, this you know.      But in secret he sends another force, which will attack, from the river.    , A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South.  They will be     in the city in two days.  Youre outnumbered Aragorn.  You need more men. ",The Return of the King

Aragorn, chebin Estel anim.   ,The Return of the King
Eowyn,Why are you doing this?  The war lies to the East.  You cannot leave on     the eve of battle.  You cannot abandon the men.   ,The Return of the King
Pippin,What were you thinking Peregrin Took?  What service can a Hobbit offer     such a great lord of men?    ,The Return of the King
Faramir," ,  It was     well done.  A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.     ,     You are to join the tower guard. ",The Return of the King
Pippin,I didnt think they would find any livery that would  fit me.  ,The Return of the King
Faramir,It once belonged to a young boy of the city.  A very foolish one who     wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies.   ,The Return of the King

Eowyn,We need you here.   ,The Return of the King
Aragorn,Why have you come? ,The Return of the King
Eowyn,Do you not know? ,The Return of the King
Aragorn,It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.  I cannot give you what     you seek.  ,The Return of the King
Aragorn, I have wished you joy since first I saw you.  ,The Return of the King
Gimli, Just where do you     think youre off to? ,The Return of the King
Aragorn,Not this time.  This time you must stay Gimli.  ,The Return of the King
Gimli, Hmmmm ,The Return of the King
Legolas, Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of     dwarves?   ,The Return of the King
Gimli,You might as well accept it.  Were going with you laddie.  Aragorn     smiles. ,The Return of the King
Soldier,"Whats happening, where is he going?  I dont understand.  , Lord Aragorn!  Why does     he leave on the eve of battle?   ",The Return of the King
Gamling,He leaves because there is no hope. ,The Return of the King
Theoden,He leaves because he must.   ,The Return of the King
Pippin,"Well, Im taller than you were then.  Though, Im not likely to grow     anymore, except sideways.   ",The Return of the King
Faramir,"It never fitted me either.  Boromir was always the soldier.     ,  They were so alike he and     my father.  Proud, stubborn even, but strong.   ",The Return of the King
Pippin,I think you have strength of a different kind.  And one day your father     will see it.   ,The Return of the King
Pippin,"Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war, in living     or dying, from ,  from this hour henceforth     until my lord release me or death take me. ",The Return of the King
Denethor,"And I shall not forget it! ,  nor fail to reward  that which is given.     ,      Fealty with love.  ,      Valour with honour.  Disloyalty with vengeance.      ,      I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences.  Defences     that your brother long held intact.   ",The Return of the King
Faramir,What would you have me do? ,The Return of the King
Denethor,I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought.  Osgiliath must be     retaken.   ,The Return of the King
Faramir,My lord Osgiliath is over run.   ,The Return of the King
Denethor,Much must be risked in war.    Is there a Captain here who still has the     courage to do his lords will?   ,The Return of the King
Faramir,You wish now that our places had been exchanged.  That I had died and     Boromir had lived.   ,The Return of the King
Denethor,"Yes, I wish that.   ",The Return of the King
Gamling,To few have come.  We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.   ,The Return of the King
Theoden," No, we cannot.  But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.      ",The Return of the King
Theoden,"I have left instruction. , The people are to follow your rule in     my stead.     Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras, if the     battle goes ill.  ",The Return of the King
Eowyn,What other duty would you have me do my lord? ,The Return of the King
Theoden,"Duty? ,     no. , I     would have you smile again, not grieve for those whose time has come. You     shall live to see these days renewed ,  and no more despair ",The Return of the King
Faramir,"Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead.     ,     If I should return, think better of me father.  ",The Return of the King
Denethor,That will depend on the manner of your return.   ,The Return of the King
Gollum, Ech!  ,The Return of the King
Sam,What are you up to?  Sneaking off are we?   ,The Return of the King

Where are Gondors armies? You still have     friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan.     Light the beacons. ",The Return of the King
Denethor,"You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have     not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen     more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against     Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides     with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son     of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the     North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship.  ",The Return of the King

Pippin,Why are they still guarding it?  ,The Return of the King
Gandalf,"They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one     day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once     was before it fell into decay. ,     The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more     splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their     descent , dearer than the names of their sons.    ,     Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers     asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.    ,     The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was     given over to lesser men.",The Return of the King

Pippin,A storm is coming. ,The Return of the King
Gandalf,"This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Saurons     making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.

When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will     begin. ",The Return of the King

Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even     the very wise cannot see all ends.  My heart tells me that Gollum has     some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over.     ,     The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many  ",The Fellowship of the Ring
Frodo,I wish the Ring had never come to me.  I wish none of     this had happened. ,The Fellowship of the Ring
Gandalf,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for     them to decide.  All we have to decide is what to do with the time that     is given to us.  There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo,     besides the will of evil.  Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which     case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought.

Frodo,What are they ? ,The Fellowship of the Ring
Strider,"They were once men. Great Kings of Men.  The Sauron     the Deciever  gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed     they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness    ,Now they are slaves to his will. They are     the Nazgl. Ringwraiths.  Neither living nor dead.

I know I dont look it, but     Im beginning to feel it in my heart. , I feel     thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a     holiday, a very long holiday.

Gan Dalf,"His defeat at Helms Deep showed our enemy one thing.    , He knows the Heir of     Elendil has come forth ,     Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough,     perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples     of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. , He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground    , before he     sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit     Rohan must be ready for war. ",The Return of the King
